    <h2> What's better: on-campus or off-campus housing?</h2>
    <p> Many international students ponder over this question when moving to a new city. Living on-campus is often preferred by first-year students because getting involved and making friends become a much simpler process. It also saves them time from searching for nearby apartments and learning about various laws and regulations surrounding leases. In addition, on-campus housing is generally guaranteed for first-year students. However, living in university residence is expensive. Not many people are able to afford such costs. International students in particular have higher tuitions to pay, and university housing coud add at least 10 000$ extra to current high fees. It is important to mention that residence costs include meal plans, so it saves a student from going to the grocery store every week. On-campus living is great for someone who wants to be more connected to the university and their fellow peers. It is also great for people who do not want to worry much about groceries or paying utilities. </p>
    <p> Living off-campus allows an individual to explore and discover boroughs in the city, outside campus. Off-campus housing is typically favoured by students in their second year or above since it could become a cheaper option depending on where you live. The downside is that there are more different costs to manage such as rent, electricity, food, internet, insurances, and other expenses. Thus, being smart with money is an essential characteristic for this way of housing. Another important aspect to consider is commuting. If you plan on living alone, apartments near university campuses often have high rent. In such cases, residing a bit further from campus and surrounding borroughs is an option if you are willing to commute. Montréal has an excellent transit system called the STM. Off-campus living could become a great experience for students who want to have their first taste of real independence. </p>
